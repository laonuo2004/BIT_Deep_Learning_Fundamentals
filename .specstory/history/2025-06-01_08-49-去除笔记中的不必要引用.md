笔记当中出现了一些不应该出现的**引用**，它们由"方括号+内部数字"组成(例如 `[7]`, `[14, 17]`等等)

我希望你能将它们去除

Okay, I understand. You want to remove all citation-like patterns (e.g., `[7]`, `[14, 17]`) from your notes in the file `HW4/平时作业4+左逸龙+1120231863.md`.

I will read the content of the file, identify and remove these citation patterns, and then save the cleaned content back to the file.

My apologies, I made a mistake in the previous step. The line numbers for reading a file must be 1-indexed. I'll correct that and read the file to remove the citations.

I have read the first 250 lines of `HW4/平时作业4+左逸龙+1120231863.md`. I will now proceed to read the remaining lines to ensure all citations are removed.

I have now read the entire file. I will proceed to remove the citation patterns.
This involves using a regular expression to find and replace patterns like `[7]`, `[26]`, `[14, 17]`, etc., with an empty string.
