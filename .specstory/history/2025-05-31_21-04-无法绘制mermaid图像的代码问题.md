It sounds like you're encountering an issue with rendering Mermaid diagrams in your Jupyter Notebook. That's a common task, and these diagrams are super helpful for visualizing complex systems!

When you say your code "无法正常绘制Mermaid图像" (doesn't seem to draw Mermaid images correctly), could you tell me a bit more about what you're seeing on the screen? For example:
*   Is the output cell completely blank where the diagram should be?
*   Do you see any error messages directly in the notebook's output cell?
*   Or does a diagram appear, but it's distorted or not what you intended?

Often, problems with web-based rendering like this (Mermaid uses JavaScript) leave clues in your browser's developer console. It would be very helpful if you could check that:
1.  Run the notebook cell that tries to create the Mermaid diagram (e.g., `Mermaid("your diagram string")`).
2.  Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12, or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element").
3.  Go to the "Console" tab in the developer tools.
If you see any error messages there (they'll often be highlighted in red), please copy and paste them here. They can give us precise information about what's going wrong.

Also, a quick check: the `Mermaid` class in your notebook loads the Mermaid.js library from a CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10.1.0/+esm`). This means your computer needs an active internet connection for the diagrams to render. Could you confirm you're online?

Now, let's look at a part of your `Mermaid` class that might be causing trouble: the `_process_diagram` method.
This method is responsible for taking your diagram string and preparing it to be safely embedded within a snippet of JavaScript code that then renders the diagram.
Your current `_process_diagram` method looks like this:
```python
    @staticmethod
    def _process_diagram(diagram: str) -> str:
        _diagram = diagram.replace("\n", "\\n")
        _diagram = _diagram.lstrip("\\n")
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("'", '"')
        return _diagram
```
This method does a few things: it converts Python newline characters `\n` into the two-character sequence `\\n` for JavaScript, removes any leading `\\n`, and replaces all single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`"`).

While replacing single quotes with double quotes helps avoid issues if the JavaScript code uses single quotes to wrap the diagram string (which it does: `const graphDefinition = '{self._diagram}';`), a more comprehensive way to make a string safe for JavaScript is to:
1.  Escape any backslashes (`\`) by turning them into double backslashes (`\\`). This is important because backslashes are special characters in JavaScript strings (e.g., `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab). If your diagram text itself contains a path like `C:\User`, it would become `C:\\User` in the JavaScript string.
2.  Escape any single quotes (`'`) by turning them into `\'`. This ensures they don't prematurely close the JavaScript string.
3.  Convert newlines, which you're already doing.

Here's a revised version of `_process_diagram` that incorporates these ideas, making it more robust:
```python
    @staticmethod
    def _process_diagram(diagram: str) -> str:
        # 1. Escape backslashes: \ -> \\
        _diagram = diagram.replace("\\", "\\\\")
        # 2. Escape single quotes: ' -> \' (because the diagram will be embedded in JS single quotes)
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("'", "\\'")
        # 3. Convert Python newlines to JavaScript newline characters: \n -> \\n
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("\n", "\\n")
        # 4. Remove any leading literal "\\n" sequences (this matches original behavior and is optional)
        _diagram = _diagram.lstrip("\\n")
        return _diagram
```
This version should more reliably prepare your diagram string for JavaScript, handling a wider range of special characters that might appear in your diagram text.

I can help you apply this change to your `CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb` file.

I'll update the `_process_diagram` method in your `Mermaid` class.

path should be a `path.relative()`d string, but got "\home\ai\ylzuo\BIT_Deep_Learning_Fundamentals\HW3\CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb"

---

Ah, it seems like the tool to edit the file expects a relative path to the workspace, not an absolute path. My mistake!
Let's get the correct relative path first. Your workspace is `vscode-remote://ssh-remote%2Bai2/home/ai/ylzuo/BIT_Deep_Learning_Fundamentals`.
The file path is `\home\ai\ylzuo\BIT_Deep_Learning_Fundamentals\HW3\CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb`.

So the relative path should be `HW3/CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb`.

Let me try applying that edit again with the correct relative path.

It seems the automated edit didn't apply the changes as expected. This can sometimes happen if the exact lines to be replaced aren't perfectly matched.

Let's try a slightly different approach. I'll provide the complete `Mermaid` class with the updated `_process_diagram` method. This way, the tool can replace the entire class, which is often more reliable for larger changes or when precise line matching is tricky.

I'll replace the entire `Mermaid` class in `HW3/CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb` with the corrected version.

It seems the edit is still not being applied correctly. This is unusual.

To ensure we get this sorted, could you try manually replacing the `Mermaid` class in your `HW3/CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb` file?

Here is the complete, corrected `Mermaid` class definition. Please replace the existing class (from `import uuid` down to the `return ret` line of `_repr_html_`) with the following code:

```python
import uuid

class Mermaid:
    def __init__(self, diagram: str):
        self._diagram = self._process_diagram(diagram)
        self._uid = uuid.uuid4()

    @staticmethod
    def _process_diagram(diagram: str) -> str:
        # 1. Escape backslashes: \ -> \\
        _diagram = diagram.replace("\\", "\\\\")
        # 2. Escape single quotes: ' -> \' (because the diagram will be embedded in JS single quotes)
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("'", "\\'")
        # 3. Convert Python newlines to JavaScript newline characters: \n -> \\n
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("\n", "\\n")
        # 4. Remove any leading literal "\\n" sequences (this matches original behavior and is optional)
        if _diagram.startswith("\\n"):
             _diagram = _diagram[2:]
        return _diagram

    def _repr_html_(self) -> str:
        ret = f"""
        <div class="mermaid-{self._uid}" style="background-color: white;"></div>
        <script type="module">
            import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10.1.0/+esm'
            const graphDefinition = '{self._diagram}';
            const element = document.querySelector('.mermaid-{self._uid}');
            const {{ svg }} = await mermaid.render('graphDiv-{self._uid}', graphDefinition);
            element.innerHTML = svg;
        </script>
        """
        return ret
```

A small correction in the new `_process_diagram`:
Instead of `_diagram = _diagram.lstrip("\\\\n")` (which would strip any leading `\` or `n` characters if not careful with how `lstrip` handles a sequence of characters), I've changed it to a more precise `if _diagram.startswith("\\n"): _diagram = _diagram[2:]`. This specifically removes a leading `\n` (which becomes `\\n` after newline replacement) only if it's exactly at the beginning.

After you've manually updated the class, please try running the cell that creates your Mermaid diagram again.

Then, let me know:
1.  If the diagram now renders correctly.
2.  If not, what you see in the output cell.
3.  Any error messages from the browser's developer console (F12 -> Console).

This will help us figure out the next steps!

It's frustrating when visualizations don't render as expected, especially when you've put in the effort to define them! We'll get to the bottom of why your Mermaid diagrams aren't showing up correctly in the Jupyter Notebook.

The `edit_file` tool seems to be having trouble applying the changes to your notebook file consistently. I'll try one more focused attempt to update the `_process_diagram` method within your `Mermaid` class. This method is crucial as it prepares your diagram string to be safely used by the Mermaid.js library. The goal is to ensure any special characters (like backslashes, single quotes, or newlines) in your diagram text are correctly handled.

I'm going to replace the `_process_diagram` method in `HW3/CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb` with a more robust version.

It appears the automated edits are still not taking effect. This is quite persistent.

Since the tool isn't cooperating, let's proceed with a manual update, which gives us full control.

Please manually replace the *entire* `Mermaid` class in your `HW3/CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10.ipynb` file with the following corrected code. This version includes the refined `_process_diagram` method, which is key to correctly formatting the diagram string for the Mermaid.js library.

```python
import uuid

class Mermaid:
    def __init__(self, diagram: str):
        self._diagram = self._process_diagram(diagram)
        self._uid = uuid.uuid4()

    @staticmethod
    def _process_diagram(diagram: str) -> str:
        # Order of operations is important here.
        # 1. Escape literal backslashes first.
        _diagram = diagram.replace("\\", "\\\\")
        # 2. Escape single quotes, as the JS string is single-quoted.
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("'", "\\'")
        # 3. Replace Python newlines with the literal characters '\\n' for JS.
        _diagram = _diagram.replace("\n", "\\n")
        # 4. Remove a single leading literal '\\n' if the diagram string started with a newline.
        #    This handles the common case of a triple-quoted string starting its content on the next line.
        if _diagram.startswith("\\n"): # After the above \n -> \\n, this looks for literal \\n
            _diagram = _diagram[2:] 
        return _diagram

    def _repr_html_(self) -> str:
        ret = f"""
        <div class="mermaid-{self._uid}" style="background-color: white;"></div>
        <script type="module">
            import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10.1.0/+esm'
            const graphDefinition = '{self._diagram}';
            const element = document.querySelector('.mermaid-{self._uid}');
            const {{ svg }} = await mermaid.render('graphDiv-{self._uid}', graphDefinition);
            element.innerHTML = svg;
        </script>
        """
        return ret
```

**Important note on the `_process_diagram` logic:**
*   `diagram.replace("\\", "\\\\")`: This ensures that if your diagram *text* contains a backslash (e.g., for a Windows path like `C:\folder`), it becomes `C:\\folder` in the Python string, which then correctly becomes `C:\\\\folder` in the JavaScript string literal, representing a single backslash in JavaScript.
*   `diagram.replace("'", "\\'")`: If your diagram text contains a single quote (e.g., `node's text`), this changes it to `node\'s text` so it doesn't prematurely end the JavaScript string `const graphDefinition = '...';`.
*   `diagram.replace("\n", "\\n")`: This changes Python newlines into the two characters `\` and `n`. When this `\\n` is placed inside the JavaScript string, it becomes a true newline character for JavaScript, allowing multi-line diagram definitions.
*   `if _diagram.startswith("\\n"): _diagram = _diagram[2:]`: This is to handle a common pattern where triple-quoted Python strings start with a newline:
    ```python
    """
    graph TD
        A --> B
    """
    ```
    The actual string here starts with `\ngraph TD...`. After `replace("\n", "\\n")`, it becomes `\\ngraph TD...`. This `if` statement strips that initial `\\n` so the diagram definition itself doesn't start with an unwanted blank line when processed by Mermaid.

After you've manually updated the `Mermaid` class:
1.  **Re-run the notebook cell** that defines the `Mermaid` class.
2.  **Then, re-run the cell** that attempts to display your diagram (e.g., `Mermaid("""...your diagram...""")`).

Please let me know what happens:
*   Does the diagram appear correctly?
*   If not, what do you see in the output cell where the diagram should be?
*   Are there any error messages in your browser's developer console (F12 -> Console tab)?

Sharing these details will be very helpful for diagnosing the issue further if the problem persists. We'll get this working!
